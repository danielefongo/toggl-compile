# toggl-tracker

**toggl-tracker** is a simple nodejs tool to automatically generate time entries on Toggl. It can be used in 2 different ways:
- **append** mode, by recording from the last recorded activity.
- **picky** mode, by compiling not-filled selected past (and future) holes.

## Getting started

### Setup
To use toggl-tracker just install it from npm and run it:
```
npm install -g toggl-tracker

* **toggl token**
